# I develop this app by using java in android studio to built frontend and I used php to write the Api and I also used mysql for the database to built the backend.

Implementation Details

When the app is clicked it will open up with a splash screen and login page is displayed. User needs to login with their account to prove their identity 
before using.
f the user does not have an account, he/she can sign up for a new account by inputting his/her name,username, email id and password. The signed in users 
can access the dashboard and computer features. 
After users logged in successfully, they will have access to the home page as shown below.
Its shown as todayâ€™s and total list. Here, the computers are classified as working, processed, problematic, dispatched, not received and E-waste. 
It fetches the data from the database.
The next one is when users click the menu bar icon, the navigation bar is showed as below. It contains three main features Dashboard, Computer and 
Logout section. 
After that when Computer section is clicked, the newly inserted computers list is shown within each detail. Affritrack number,  a short description 
that includes the storage, brand, status image and date with specified time are included in the view.
Finally when logout section is clicked, it will appear like shown below asking whether the user is sure to logout or not. If No, the user stays on 
the page and if yes the user will logout of the page.

 Conclusion
This project is found interesting from a technical point of view as it involves android app development, implementing a navigator to tell the users about 
common features, implementing a database to to track information about computers, update daily classified lists of computers and ensuring that is simple 
and easy to use.
